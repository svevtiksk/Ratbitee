ent-GasPressurePumpHighFlow = high flow gas pump
    .desc = A pump that moves gas by pressure. It pumps air at three times the pressure of a standard pump.
ent-GasVolumePumpHighFlow = high flow volumetric gas pump. It pumps air at three times the volume of a standard pump
    .desc = A pump that moves gas by volume.
ent-GasDualPortVentPumpHighFlow = high flow dual-port air vent
    .desc = Has a valve and a pump attached to it. There are two ports, one is an input for releasing air, the other is an output when siphoning. It can handle three times the pressure of a standard vent.
